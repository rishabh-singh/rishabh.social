				Project Scenario: Migration of a Wordpress site from LAMP based VM to Docker Containers<br>
				
				<div class="role">
					<u>Description:</u> A customer had his website running over Wordpress. The website was hosted on EC2 on a LAMP environment. The website and all it's contents were all on the same machine, with the database being on RDS. The idea was to seperate each component of the website, to make it stateless and use Docker containers to run the Wordpress engine.<br><br>

				Project Scenario: Automation of AMI creation for multiple customers<br>
				
				<div class="role">
					<u>Description:</u> Being a managed service provider, my first comapny had several customers which had their workload running on AWS Cloud. The customers had several VM, for which backup was required. Creating AMI was one major backup strategy which we depended on. The creation process was manual. Retention was also to be ensured as many copies of AMI would incur cost. There was no tracking availabe and thus when the number of clients and their respective VMs increased, it was getting difficult to manage this backup process. This solution was fully automated using AWS SDK for Java. Mailing feature was introduced on successful and failed backups for efficient tracking.<br><br>

				Project Scenario: Deploying of code to pre-prod EC2 on every push to GitHub, using CodeDeploy<br>
				
				<div class="role">
					<u>Description:</u> A customer had his website running on a LAMP stack. There were two environments, one pre-prod and one prod. There was a need to automate the process of deploying fresh code onto the pre-prod environment and if successful, deploying to prod environment on a single click. Thus, GitHub was introduced in the solution as the customer's dev team was familiar with it. AWS CodeDeploy served as a perfect solution for the remaining bit of requirement.<br><br>

			</div>
			<p class="role">
				I am a problem solver, a deep thinker and one keen observer. I like analysing people, situation, problems and what not. Once someone said "I wish to be a learner each day". I strongly resonate with this philosophy. Thanks to my ability to reason out what's right and what isn't, I often pickup traits that I should and drop the ones that are not right.<br>
				I like to do lots of things. Hobbies keep changing. I know about a lot of things, but haven't mastered anything as of yet, thus the saying "Jack of all trades and master of none" suits me well. Maybe someday I master some art.<br>
				I was born and brought up in the holy city of Benaras. I did my schooling from there only, and yes, Benaras does have very good schools. I moved to NCR for my higher education. I was shy for the most part of my childhood, an obidient one too add to that. I scored really good in my school days. Moved to college and began investing time in activities other than studies. I started playing a lot, organising events at college, participating in lots of stuff, and that to me was the ice breaker. From a shy person, I evolved int a confident public person.<br>
				Right now my work involves providing cloud based solution to customers, revolving specifically around AWS. I like automation a lot, and that is for now my current goal, to atleast pickup a couple of technologies that is important for automation. DevOps is the way for now.<br>
				I'll keep adding to my Blogs, where I would like to connect with you all.
